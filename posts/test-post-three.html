        Alright, cool. We're deployed and everything seems to be working fairly well. Still look sluggish, but we'll have to come up with some small tools here and there. Right now, Lighthouse really only tells usability scores and performance metrics generally need to make this sort of a runtime function argument or something like the Matlab profiler where we break down degraded performance by function library call.

        If this works I can start my actual first blog post entry. Hooray! I'll go ahead and delete all the tests once we're done.
