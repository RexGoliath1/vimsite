        Alright, so... I've been meaning to do this for a while. I've got all
        these projects going — the drone, the MTG bot, the pension thing — and
        I realized I have no record of the thinking that goes into them. Just
        code and commits.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea here is simple. I talk into Spokenly, it captures what I'm
        saying with these Nvidia Parakeet models — which are honestly wild,
        the accuracy is really solid — and then I do a light cleanup pass and
        post it here. Spoken word as source material.
      </p>

        I like that it's messy. It's not a polished Medium post. It's closer
        to a lab notebook than a blog. That's the vibe I want.
      </p>

      <p>
        What's coming: I want to get some WebAssembly visualizations embedded
        for the drone nav stuff. Like, imagine being able to show a factor
        graph optimizing in real time in the browser. That's the dream. And
        for the pension analysis, some D3 charts showing the funding gap over
        time. Interactive stuff, not just screenshots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, this is entry one. More soon.
