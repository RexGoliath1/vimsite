          Alright, this is a little bit of a test of the blog, but also just rambling. If you're
          chronically uh on Twitter (X), like I am, you're wondering why people are buying Mac minis
          and Mac Pros.
        </p>

        <p>
          You get a lot of security researchers and general computer science individuals, like
          Primgen, Theo, DHH, Dax, etc. They're giving their take on the state of things like
          Claude, codex, open claw. Stuff that a normal person doesn't really think about.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main thread I've seen is that OpenClaw is a security disaster. Mulplook is ridiculous.
          These are not agents interacting with each other, these are just 4chan users making agents
          say provocative things. Definitely true.
        </p>

        <p>
          The thing I haven't seen discussed much is why people are actually buying these Mac minis
          and Mac Pros. Why a clown like @Jason is posting his server racks and his replacement of
          staff With OpenClaw instances that hook up to a bunch of APIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the sort of impetus for these blog posts of mine. Because clearly the right answer
          is "go implement a secure container or VM environment on some remote server that doesn't
          touch my stuff."
        </p>

        <p>
          The real answer actually has to do with the capabilities of Codex and Claude Code as it
          stands. These agentic environments seem to be actually primarily geared toward users that
          are running them bare metal on their computers. There's a lot of hoops to jump through if
          you're trying to authenticate claude or codex on a remote server to actually run using
          your Max or whatever subscription model that you're using. (I will note that API users are
          a bit less limited in their headless operations in secure Linux environments on certain
          cloud instances.)
        </p>

        <p>
          # Remote Limitations If you're transferring from a local to a more secure environment like
          a container or a remote instance, good on you. You recognize how crazy it is to run
          --dangerously-skip-permissions with where we've been in LLM capability. Sure, Karpathy
          will probably tell you to just go with the flow, but that's a really bad idea if you're
          just some Joe Schmo.
        </p>

        <p>
          The problem is headless permissions are a second-class citizen. There's certain instances
          where Claude can't even call Claude itself from another process. It seems that the creator
          of Claude Code heavily tied resource utilization and disk space permissions together. The
          get tree workflows are simply a hack that are inherited by all other instances of lllms:
          KIMI, openCode, etc included.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's not to say that cloud instances of open claw and Claude Code are dead on arrival.
          Just that they are currently a workflow that is not optimized for the current providers
          that actually matter (sorry Dax, I just don't think your buisiness models works not matter
          how good of a programmer you are).
        </p>

        <p>
          So of course, if you're trying to navigate websites that do not have APIs and you're not
          somebody who knows the playwright mechanisms, you would, of course, default to agentic
          workflows.
        </p>

        <p>This is the point of this blog.</p>

        <p>
          # My use case (Amtrak train travel suggestions: Google Flight) I wanted to automate Amtrak
          schedules to give a sort of Google Flights workflow where I can understand what the best
          deals are for units that That have a bed in them that would allow something like the
          European model of night trains to exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          The thing is, this use case is littered with dead projects of the past. With the common
          thread being that Amtrak simply does not have an api sdk to actually enable what I want it
          to do. The only reasonable alternative is a playwright workflow. But take that to the next
          step. If I have to learn Playwright and all of its parameters and how it navigates
          websites, why would I not just have an OpenClaw instance that runs on a Mac mini that does
          the thing I want it to do?
        </p>

        <p>
          ## The future / results The problem, as I posed it, to Claude, is this: Amtrak as a
          federally funded institution simply does not have the software, engineering, capacity, or
          institution to mandate this API SDK. Maybe this is a special interests project, maybe this
          is just lack of funding, or maybe it's just the fact that the service itself is very
          unknown unless you are in a small segment of the population that cares about train travel.
        </p>

        <p>
          The thing is, if I automate this process and actually provide this as a service of sorts,
          the Amtrak site is dead. It was not made to handle these agentic workflows.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've seen this in my real life with the Apple phone number. blocking system simply being
          non-functional, even if you limit it to your context, because Because the back half of
          that service allows local incoming calls. This is a real problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another thing you've probably heard from Twitter is that the Gmail filters are simply not
          working anymore. This is completely true. I get multiple spam messages every day crafted
          by very eloquent llms that are impossible to actually filter anymore.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pure irony is that as we see things like Groq/Cerebras/Extropic and lower energy high
          intelligence LLMs actually being able to be deployed by anyone on earth means that the
          systems that we've created over the past decades of software engineering will simply not
          work anymore. It will simply be a requirement to have agentic workflows validate checks of
          DDoS attacks and other insidious mechanisms against agentic work flows. The matrix will
          require the matrix itself to verify identity / intent.
        </p>

        <p>
          ## The test Let's now talk about what I actually built. This is a web scraper that uses
          the Claude workplace workflow in lieu of OpenClaw. I simply do not trust the main
          developer of that application.
        </p>

        <p>
          This service looks at every instance of a Chicago train travel location to any other place
          in the country that is within a one or two day distance of me. (Yes, I am admitting that I
          live in Chicago.)
        </p>

        <p>
          This application runs every week and uses the clawed coworking space to navigate the
          Amtrak website. This is absurd if you've ever been an API SDK developer. The Amtrak
          service, which is mandated by the Federal Government to provide the correct train travel
          locations and Links to ticket purchase is simply unnavigatable by programmatic standards.
        </p>

        <p>Thus the need for something like a playwright or claude workspace application.</p>

        <p>
          The service logs in, looks at train devices between Chicago and any nearby latitude and
          longitude coordinates of cities of interest to mine, and publishes that to a very
          simplified blog that I have made.
        </p>

        <p>
          The code is referenced inside of this blog post at the end. However, this is a call to say
          "Hey, this is really awesome. You can do amazing things with this. Please don't, as I'm
          worried that this might really break a lot of assumptions on federal services."
        </p>

        <p>
          Maybe the right answer to this is "Go ahead and break these things so that the Federal
          Government can actually implement these these things correctly."
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm just a little worried that we live in a time right now where that is not possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          ## Expansion / Conclusion I won't be expanding this service. This is only for my use in
          figuring out correct transit options between my city and others that I'm interested in
          visiting.
        </p>

        <p>
          But this is a guideline warning of "why people are buying these Mac minis and Mac Studio
          pros"
        </p>

        <p>
          The Mac mini on a good day as it stands costs around $600-$750. The Mac Studio, depending
          on the model that you're getting, costs around $2000+.
        </p>

        <p>
          For reference, the projections that my Claude instance says my AWS instance will cause is
          around $5 per month. So, needless to say, these are pretty large magnitudes off. I can
          certainly publish my own usage statistics, but frankly I almost certainly exceed the max
          ratings of token usage every month. This is simply not a limitation of the actual server
          it is ready none.
        </p>

        <p>
          What is super interesting is the barrier to entry around headless development of VM or
          containerized environments of these instances of agenic uses. What's also somewhat
          interesting is that some of the workflows, both in Codex and ClaudCode, are also limited
          on a per usage basis. This seems to be an inherent design flaw in these systems as they
          exist right now, which is causing the spike in the usage of easy to purchase dumb
          instances like the Mac Mini and Mac Studio.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyway, thought I would let people know about this. It makes sense in the context of
          playwright and open claws' ability to Programmatically step through web pages and such.
          (Good god, I hope people are actually understanding the severity of security implications
          of that repo. The openClaw developer seems intelligent, but way in over his head without
          OpenAI support staff that seems to be what Sama has planned.)
        </p>

        <p>
          # Final thoughts We are entering into a world of mass agenic workflows. The websites of
          old are simply unequipped to handle this sort of traffic. It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
